      <h3>Challenge 1 (Multiples of 3 or 5)</h3>
      <p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. <br>
         Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the input parameter value number.

          <li><b>Natural Numbers</b> are counting numbers from 1 to infinity. <br>
              To ensure all the numbers are tested before reaching input value, <code>for</code> statement is used. <br>
              The initial value is set to 1, the condition is true until reaching input value, then the initial value is incremented by 1.
          </li>
          <li><b>Multiples of Numbers</b> can be determined when products are formed from a certain number multiplies with an integer. <br>
              This condition statement <code>input%number === 0</code> is required. <br>
              Whenever the remainder of modulo operation is strictly equal to 0, the input is indeed the multiplies of the number.
          </li>
          <li><b>Sum</b> is an addition of all numbers. <br>
              Since it involves several numbers to be added, an array is initialized with empty array. <br>
              A variable for sum is initialized with 0, so that there is a value for the first index of the array to be added. <br>
              To add all the numbers that are listed in array, <code>for</code> statement is used. <br>
              The initial value is set to 0 (indicates the first index of the array), the condition is true until reached all indexes,
              then the initial value is incremented by 1. <br>
              The sum calculation <code>mySum += myArray[index]</code> is nested within <code>for</code> statement.
