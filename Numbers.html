      <h3>Challenge 1 (Multiples of 3 or 5)</h3>
      <p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. <br>
         Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the input number.

          <li><b>Natural Numbers</b> are counting numbers from 1 to infinity. <br>
              To ensure all the numbers are tested before reaching input value, <code>for</code> statement is used. <br>
              The initial value is set to 1, the condition is true until reaching input value, then the initial value is incremented by 1.
          </li>
          <li><b>Multiples of Numbers</b> can be determined when products are formed from a certain number multiplies with an integer. <br>
              This condition statement <code>input%number === 0</code> is required. <br>
              Whenever the remainder of modulo operation is strictly equal to 0, the input is indeed the multiplies of the number.
          </li>
          <li><b>Sum</b> is an addition of all numbers. <br>
              Since it involves several numbers to be added, an array is initialized with empty array. <br>
              A variable for sum is initialized with 0, so that there is a value for the first index of the array to be added. <br>
              To add all the numbers that are listed in array, <code>for</code> statement is used. <br>
              The initial value is set to 0 (indicates the first index of the array), the condition is true until reached all indexes,
              then the initial value is incremented by 1. <br>
              The sum calculation <code>mySum += myArray[index]</code> is nested within <code>for</code> statement.

    <h3>Challenge 2 (Even Fibonacci Numbers)</h3>
    <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. <br>
       By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... <br>
       By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed input number, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

        <li><b>Sum</b> is an addition of all numbers. <br>
            To add all even numbers in the series, <code>for</code> statement is used. <br>

            the initial value is increment by 1. <br>

            the current number and previous number. <br>
            Initialize <code>previous</code> and <code>current</code> as 1 and 2 respectively, since the numbers are the starting operands for the series. <br>
            After undergoes several executions, rearrange them into array <code>[previous, current] = [current, previous+current]</code> so that the
            state of previous and current numbers will always changed when the series is expanding.
